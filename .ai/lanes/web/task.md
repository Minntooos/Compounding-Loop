# Lane: web — round 5 (0.5.0 "Cockpit")

Run: 1 / 20
Status: in progress (unit 1)
Round 4 record: `.ai/lanes/web/done-v4.md` (`git show 02874e8:.ai/lanes/web/task.md` for its Decisions).
How a run works: `.ai/lane-run.md` (cheap stop checks, steering, run log, idle backoff).

## Contract
**Goal:** the cockpit: in 5 seconds the owner knows what needs them and what is running, and can steer any lane or unit in one sentence (IDEA.md Round 5 A2-A4, A6, A8, C1-C8).
**Owns (globs from `.ai/lanes.json`):** web/**, tests/e2e/**, tests/unit/web/**
**Done when:**
- `npm test` passes.
- Round 5 audit section with no open blocker; A3, A4, A6 and A8 have regression tests.
- The e2e list in IDEA.md "Round 5 done when", with GitHub and npm mocked through Playwright routing, passes.
- axe: zero serious or critical violations on every screen, both themes, at 1440 and 375 px; no horizontal page scroll at 375 px; zero console errors.
- An independent design reviewer verdict for every unit is recorded in `.ai/audit/web.md`, and the final home screenshot answers the five 5-second questions with "yes".
- JS bundle under 300 kB gzip.
**Constraints:** edit only the paths you own, plus the smallest edit to shared files (CLAUDE.md "Lanes"). Read anything. Unacknowledged `next-run` entries in `steer.md` come before this list.
**Out of scope:** Data shaping and routes (server), parsers and commands (core). Ask in your outbox; use demo fixtures while you wait, never invent data shapes.

## Units, in order
1. Round 5 re-audit (`.ai/audit/web.md`), starting from your afa659e design review and the owner's P0 list (IDEA.md A).
2. DESIGN.md first: the status strip, needs-you row, heat-map cell + legend, steer composer, schedule controls, Releases list. Then A3, A4, A6, A8 (P0 polish) with tests.
3. C1 status strip + C2 Needs you (one shared attention list feeds the banner, the strip and the Inbox).
4. C4 steer composer (+ history with acknowledgements) and C5 schedule controls; demo opens prefilled GitHub URLs, local saves through the API.
5. C3 lane × hour heat map (from `classifyRunSlots`) and the Runs tab link.
6. C6 next round with ingredients, Draft with Claude (SSE) and Copy prompt; Go stays a separate click. C7 Releases.
7. After-screenshots for docs (optimised PNGs under 400 kB, replace the 5.4 MB phone shots), then audit majors.

## Decisions

## Confirmed

## Guesses

## Tried

## Don't
- Edit paths another lane owns (a fix to a red `main` is the one exception; say so in your outbox).
- Change the Operating Card, the version, `.ai/lane-run.md` or `.ai/control-run.md`; publish, tag or dispatch `release.yml`.

## Handoff
Not started. Read IDEA.md's Round 5 section and `.ai/lane-run.md`, then do unit 1.
